System Design Introduction:

Characteristics:

1. Features
2. Define API'System
3. Avaialability
4. Latency -> Super fast, cache,etc
5. Performance -> 
6. Scalability -> 
7. Durability -> Data can be stroed securely and not compromised
8. Class diagrams
9. Security and privacy -> Authentication
10. Cost effective


Concepts:

1. Vertical vs Horizontal scaling - done
2. SQL vs NoSql - done
3. CAP Theorom  - done
   - Consistency, Availability, Partition
4. ACID vs BASE - done
   Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durabilty -> SQL
   Basically available soft state eventual consistency -> NoSQL
5. Sharding -> consistent hashing - done
6. Optimistic vs pessimistic locking -> optional-- vague
7. Strong vs eventual consistency - done
8. Types of NoSQL -> KeyValue, Wide column, 
                     document based, graph based  - done
9.  Caching - done
10. Datacenter, racks, hosts
11. Random vs Sequential read\write
12. http vs https
13. TCP/IP model
14. IPV4 vs IPV6 - >128 bit
15. TCP vs UDP
16. DNS lookup
17. SSL\TLS
18. Public key infrastructure
19. Load balancers - 
20. CDNs and EDGE servers
21. Virtual Machines
22. Publisher-Subscriber over queue 

System architecture
  1. cache
  2. Load balancers
  3. CDNs
  4. Virtual Machines
  5. Publisher-Subscriber over queue
  6. API gateway
  7. web crawling
  8. web scrapping
Database
   1. Vertical vs Horizontal scaling - done

   7. Strong vs eventual consistency - done
   8. Types of NoSQL -> KeyValue, Wide column, 
                        document based, graph based  - done
   9. Random vs Sequential read\write
Networking
  1. telnet\ssh - terminal emulation program, simple command line tool alternate option of secure shell (ssh)
  2. Datacenter, racks, hosts, servers
  3. proxy servers
  4. firewall
  5. http vs https
  6. ssl\TLS
  7. TCP\IP model
  8. TCP vs UDP
  9. DNS
  10. SMTP
  11. POP3 vs IMAP
  12. DDOS Attack
  13. half duplex vs full duplex
  14. FTP
  15. RAM 
  16. IPv4 vs IPV6 12:34:45:256
  17. VPN
Cryptography
  1. symmetric Cryptography
  2. assymetric Cryptography
  3. Public key infrastructure
  4. Encryption algorithms like AES, RSA, DES, etc
Computer architecture
  1. Parallel vs concurrency
  2. Threading
  3. Deadlock
  4. deamon process
  5.
